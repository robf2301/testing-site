    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>It can be defined as persisting in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. To persevere you need an attitude of nothing and nobody is going to stop you. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Phil 4:13
God created us to persevere with His help. God planned in advance that He would lovingly create humans that interact with Him and He made laws to keep us safe from harm. When hardships come it is to purify us and make us even more
dependant on Him.</p>
<p>“And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.”
‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭32:40‬ ‭KJV‬‬
John 6:34-40, John 10:28-29, Ps 73:24</p>
<p>Perseverance causes you to be victorious.</p>
<p>“You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭10:36‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
<p>“All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭11:13‬ ‭NIV</p>
<p>“Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.”
‭‭James‬ ‭1:2-4‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
<p>“Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.”
‭‭James‬ ‭1:12‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
<p>“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;”
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭6:18‬ ‭KJV‬‬</p>
<p>“Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.
For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭37:24, 28‬ ‭KJV‬‬</p>
<p>“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭8:37-39‬ ‭KJV‬‬</p>
<p>“And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.”
‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭4:18‬ ‭KJV‬‬</p>
<p>“Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.”
‭‭1 Peter‬ ‭5:8-9‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
<p>Examples of people that persevered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timothy pesevered till the end. “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” ‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭4:7‬ ‭NIV‬‬</li>
<li>“By faith he (Moses) left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.” ‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭11:27‬ ‭NIV‬‬</li>
<li>“As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job’s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.” ‭‭James‬ ‭5:11‬ ‭NIV‬‬</li>
</ul>
<p>Strong’s Concordance mentions the following examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Joshua and Caleb persevered and consequently entered the promised land. Num 14:24,38</li>
<li>Abraham persevered in pleading for Sodom. Gen 18:23-32</li>
<li>Jacob struggled with God and told God he will not let go until God blessed him. Gen 32:24-26</li>
<li>Elijah persevered in prayer for rain. 1 Kings 18:42-45</li>
<li>Paul kept on pleading that God will remove the thorn in his flesh. 2 Cor 12:7-9</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you manage to peservere in this world?</p>
<p>“Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not treat prophecies with contempt but test them all; hold on to what is good, reject every kind of evil. May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
‭‭1 Thessalonians‬ ‭5:16-23‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
<p>We need to keep our eyes on Jesus and what is really of importance.</p>
<p>“No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer.”
‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭2:4‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
<p>Jesus persevered on the cross for our salvation.</p>
<p>“Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭12:1-2‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
