    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I believe Psalm 21 is a prayer/conversation model for us. King David had an intimate relationship with God. He shared all his ups and downs with his best friend.
(Everywhere it says king, put yourself there and pray it through daily.)</p>
<p>“The king rejoices in your strength, Lord. How great is his joy in the victories you give! You have granted him his heart’s desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. You came to greet him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head. He asked you for life, and you gave it to him— length of days, for ever and ever. Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty. Surely you have granted him unending blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence. For the king trusts in the Lord; through the unfailing love of the Most High he will not be shaken. Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes. When you appear for battle, you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace. The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath, and his fire will consume them. You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from mankind. Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed. You will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow. Be exalted in your strength, Lord; we will sing and praise your might.”
‭‭Psalm‬ ‭21:1-13‬ ‭</p>
<p>Make it your own and pray through it. Use examples out of your own life. It will be different every time you pray it.</p>
<p>Verse 1-7
I rejoice in your strength Father. I’m so thankful for your help. I know you are the only One that brings restoration and breakthrough. I lean into you and trust you alone. I thank you for finances and resources and that I will have enough to bless others. I trust you to help me fulfill my destiny here on earth and that I can live out my book of life. I believe I will have a long, happy, blessed life. Thank you for your undeserved favour, love and presence.</p>
<p>Verse 8-12
Thank you Father that you protect me from my enemies and attacks from satan. Your word says that no weapon formed against me will prosper. That I’m the head and not the tail. That I will be blessed in everything I do. That your angels surround me and keep me safe. All things work out for my good.</p>
<p>Verse 13
Praise you Father for your goodness. We exalt you. Thank you Father for your strength, thank you that I don’t have to fear anything. Thank you for your protection.</p>
