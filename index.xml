      <description>The darkness will increase, but also the light.
“Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For the darkness shall cover the earth and deep darkness the peoples; but the Lord shall rise upon you, and His glory shall be seen upon you.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭60:1-2‬ ‭MEV‬‬
A lot of positive prophecies went out for 2020 and a few negative things were also prophesied.</description>

      <description>I feel more tingling of the Holy Spirit (presence) in my right hand than in my left hand. Later I heard somebody talk about Satan that came to people’s left side and brought demonic interference - I also know that Jesus is seated at the right side of the Father. I felt God wanted me to explore this. “and He raised us up and seated us together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,” ‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:6‬ ‭MEV‬‬</description>

      <description>Submit to God, but at the same time take authority.
We were made to rule. “Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.</description>

      <description>The chapter starts where God says He will honour Galilee.

      <description>I’ve read this so many times, but never really understood what it meant.
“Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</description>
