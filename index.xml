      <description>The darkness will increase, but also the light.
“Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For the darkness shall cover the earth and deep darkness the peoples; but the Lord shall rise upon you, and His glory shall be seen upon you.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭60:1-2‬ ‭MEV‬‬
A lot of positive prophecies went out for 2020 and a few negative things were also prophesied.</description>

      <title>The Right Hand</title>

      <description>I feel more tingling of the Holy Spirit (presence) in my right hand than in my left hand. Later I heard somebody talk about Satan that came to people’s left side and brought demonic interference - I also know that Jesus is seated at the right side of the Father. I felt God wanted me to explore this. “and He raised us up and seated us together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,” ‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:6‬ ‭MEV‬‬</description>

      <description>JESUS “And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.”” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭1:21‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
He is also called:
  Yeshua The Hebrew and Aramaic name for Jesus.
  The Lamb of God “The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</description>

      <description>Submit to God, but at the same time take authority.
We were made to rule. “Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.</description>

      <description>The chapter starts where God says He will honour Galilee. The people will see light in the darkness and it prophesies the coming of our Saviour. “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.</description>

      <title>The Parable of the Tenants</title>

      <description>I’ve read this so many times, but never really understood what it meant.
“Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</description>

      <guid>https://www.janineforsyth.com/posts/the-fig-tree/</guid>
      <description>“Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭11:13-14‬ ‭NIV‬‬
Jesus expected the fig tree to have fruit even out of season.</description>

      <title>Resurrection Power</title>

      <description>A few times over the last couple of weeks God has reminded me that I have resurrection power. It’s a fact that all spirit-filled Christians have resurrection power living inside of them. “Yes, God raised Jesus to life! And since God’s Spirit of Resurrection lives in you, he will also raise your dying body to life by the same Spirit that breathes life into you!” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭8:11‬ ‭TPT‬‬ “For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.</description>

      <description>Our alarm went off at 2h30 one morning. There was nothing wrong, but I felt that it was a warning from God. Later I read that Jennifer Eivaz also wrote about it in her book ‘The Intercessor’s handbook’. “Ron ( Jennifer’s husband) carries the heart of a watchman for our home. He guards and protects it, responding to any alarms, no matter what time of night. In the Bible, a watchman was a protector who watched over crops, city gates or walls (see Isaiah 62:6; Jeremiah 51:12; Ezekiel 33:2–3).</description>

      <title>Identity, Inheritance, Authority and Power</title>
      <link>https://www.janineforsyth.com/posts/identity-inheritance-authority-and-power/</link>

      <description>Often Christians lack identity. They struggle to understand that Jesus paid the full price and because of that Father God sees them as perfect. For various reasons people struggle to feel loved and cared for. The truth is that God is love and if you read your Bible you will see it. Stop believing the lie of satan that you are not good enough. People will sin and God gives them opportunity to repent.</description>

      <title>Book of Life</title>

      <description>Everything God planned for us is written in the book of life. We must navigate it with the Holy Spirit’s help for it to happen. It is all the good things that God planned ahead of time.
“You saw who you created me to be before I became me! Before I’d ever seen the light of day, the number of days you planned for me were already recorded in your book.</description>

      <title>Psalm 21</title>

      <guid>https://www.janineforsyth.com/posts/psalm-21/</guid>
      <description>I believe Psalm 21 is a prayer/conversation model for us. King David had an intimate relationship with God. He shared all his ups and downs with his best friend. (Everywhere it says king, put yourself there and pray it through daily.)
“The king rejoices in your strength, Lord. How great is his joy in the victories you give! You have granted him his heart’s desire and have not withheld the request of his lips.</description>

      <description>I feel people get easily mislead by certain things. If you watch/read the news here in South Africa you hear negative things all the time. You hear how weak the rand is or how expensive medical aid will become or about people sadly losing their lives. It’s all real, but sad and depressing news. Use the news as an opportunity to pray instead of expecting the worst. Pray and decree financial stability, that our leaders will know God, for the safety of all our people.</description>

      <title>Be Bold</title>

      <description>Boldness (confidence/courage) can be defined as the willingness to take risks and act innovatively. Christians should be known for their boldness. Scripture says we can do all things through Him that gives us strength. Phil 4:13
“The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.” ‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭28:1‬ ‭NIV‬‬
“So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</description>

      <title>Surrender</title>
      <link>https://www.janineforsyth.com/posts/surrender/</link>

      <description>To surrender means to stop resisting and to submit to God’s authority. You stop living a life where your selfish needs come first and start following God’s plans for your life. Through your process of surrendering to God you will find your destiny and purpose on Earth. In order to surrender we need to let go of some things and embrace the new things that come on our path.
“‘Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.</description>

      <description>It can be defined as persisting in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. To persevere you need an attitude of nothing and nobody is going to stop you. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Phil 4:13 God created us to persevere with His help. God planned in advance that He would lovingly create humans that interact with Him and He made laws to keep us safe from harm.</description>
