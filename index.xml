“Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For the darkness shall cover the earth and deep darkness the peoples; but the Lord shall rise upon you, and His glory shall be seen upon you.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭60:1-2‬ ‭MEV‬‬
A lot of positive prophecies went out for 2020 and a few negative things were also prophesied.</description>
